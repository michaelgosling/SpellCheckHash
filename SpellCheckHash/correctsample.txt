This is a sample document used to test the accuracy of your spell checker. It includes special characters, like a pound (#) sign, an ampersand (&) and "quotation marks" that should be ignored by the spell checker. Along with the special characters, the document includes the numbers 1, 2 and 3 which should also be ignored by the spell checker, but, of course, if those numbers were displayed as the words "one", "two" or "three", they should be included in the spell checking.
