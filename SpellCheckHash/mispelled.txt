This is a sample document used to test the accuracy of your spell checkr. It includes special charcaters, like a pound (#) sign, an amprsand (&) and "quotation marks" that should be icnored by the spel checker. Along with the special characters, the docment includes the numbers 1, 2 ad 3 which should also be ignored by teh spell checker, but, ofcourse, if those numbers were displayed as the words "one", "two" or "thre", they should be included in the spell checking.
